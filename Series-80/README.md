<h2>Notes</h2>
I use small M 2.5 screws with brass inserts to close the cases. thin brass washers can be glued into the recesses to provide a stronger surface for the screw heads.
Inserts and washers can be glued in with steel filled epoxy in double syringes which gives a stiffer bond than the more flexible clear epoxy glues.
Self tapping screws do not go well with PLA - maybe you have better luck or use ABS.
