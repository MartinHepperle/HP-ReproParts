Some parts for Series-80 computers (85, 86, 87, 9915)

- case for interface modules, PRM-85 module or similar.

Notes
I use small M 2.5 screws with brass inserts to close the cases. washers can be glued in to provide a stringer face for the screw heads.
Inserts and washers can be glued in with steel filled epoxy in double syringes which gives a harder bond than the more flexible clear epoxy glues.
Self tapping screws do not go well with PLA - maybe you have better luck or use ABS.
