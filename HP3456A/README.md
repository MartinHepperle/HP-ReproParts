Often you receive test equipment without the mounting brackets ("ears"). These can be found on E-Bay, but here in Europe they are rarely offered.
Therefore I tried to make my own replacements.

I have used them for mounting some HP test equipment, like the 3456A voltmeters in a small 19" rack.
All parts are massive (i.e. no hollow internal structure) to provide sufficient strength, thus take about 4-5 hours to print on a hobby printer.
You should check whether the weight of your device can be properly supported.
Often it may be better to produce similar parts from sheet metal or "L"-type bar stock.

The front brackets will suit many other HP devices. I did not bother to add handles to these parts.

The rear brackets were needed to support the deep boxes, which overhang the rear end of my small rack.
They are probably not useful for other applications.
