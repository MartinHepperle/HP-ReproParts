<h1>Parts for the HP-IL Loop</h1>

<ul>
<li>Individual connectors for creating cables</li>
<li>Twin connector pair for building into devices</li>
</ul>
The "joined" parts are several small parts joined by spruces to form a single part. 
Many commercial 3D print services do not handle a set of small parts - they want a single part to simplify handling.
