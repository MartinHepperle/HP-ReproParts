# HP-ReproParts
This repository collects my 3D printable parts for obsolete computers.

These parts were created for replacing broken or missing parts of obsolete computers and peripherals for hobby purposes. 

The focus is mainly on Hewlett Packard computers.

Most of these parts have been printed on my low cost hobby printer "Anycubic Mega 3D" in PLA.
Before I owned it, I had sent the STL files to commercial 3D printing services to obtain parts in very good quality and in materials unavailable for hobby printers, e.g. very strong sintered nylon.

All parts will require some sort of rework and assembly. No batteries included.

The data is available in binary STL format, which can be used by all commercial printing services.
For your hobby printer you have to process it by your favorite slicing software (e.g. Cura) to produce the required toolpath files in GCODE format with the preferred settings for your printer.

I have spent a considerable amount of time to create these models and am happy to provide these parts for hobby purposes.
You can use these models for non-commercial purposes, but not sell the models or parts for profit.


Note to collectors: these parts are different enough from genuine spare parts so that the cannot be taken for fakes.
