Parts for Hp terminals of the 264x series.

- cover for keyboard switches
- cable hood for the serial interface cable

Some notes on the cable hoods:
I usually glue the cables into these hoods after testing them, because screws do not hold well in the relatively soft PLA material.
Also, it is simple to make another one, if needed. 
For the cables I often use ready made serial or parallel printer cables with 25 or 36 wires and replace the connctors.
This is cheaper than buying cable by the meter and one connctor is already in place.
