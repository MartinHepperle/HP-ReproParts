  <li>cover for keyboard switches</li>
  <li>cable hood for the serial interface cable</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cable Hoods:</h2>
I usually glue the cables into these hoods after testing them, because screws do not hold well in the relatively soft PLA material.
Also, it is simple to make another one, if needed. 
For the cables I often use ready made serial or parallel printer cables with 25 or 36 wires and replace the connctors.
This is cheaper than buying cable by the meter and one connctor is already in place.

<h2>HP 2640 Keyboard Cover</h2>
When printed in PLA, the retention clip nose on the keyboard switch cover may break if it is bent too much. 
Use a file or sharp knife to shorten it so that the cover is held in place without overstressing the part.
If it broke, cyanacrylate superglue may be your friend.

<h2>Color</h2>
I printed the cover in whity and painted it later.
The keyboard cover can be painted with plastic model paint like Testors, Revell or what else. 
They offer many gray/tan tones to match your more or less yellowed keyboard.

<h2>Surface Quality</h2>
3D printing usually leaves a fine structure on the surface. You may want to experiment with laye thickness and extruder temperature.
If you are a perfectionist, you can apply multiply cycles of polyester putty or spray on filler followed by wet sanding to create a smoother surface.
When printing in ABS, it might be possible to smooth the surface and close tiny gaps by applying acetone, but this is a bit on the risky side of life.
