These parts can be used to install a 3.5 inch flexible disk drive into the HP-Vectra drive cage using side rails.
The small rectangular block can be glued on with rubber cement after adjustiung the position to match the front bezel.
If necessary, it can be broken lose to remove the disk drive.
I also glued strips ofcardboard to the side of the rails to achieve smooth motion with a bit of friction.
