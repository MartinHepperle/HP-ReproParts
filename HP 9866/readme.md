These models are rear bumpers for the HP 9866 printer some HP 98x0 computers.

The original parts often become brittle and crumble into pieces.
You can print them in hard PLA oreven better use a flexible material like TPU, shore 58 or similar.

Printing them "upside down" (with the rim pointing upwards) eliminates the need for support structures.
