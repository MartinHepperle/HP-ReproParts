<h1>Parts for the HP 3421 Data Acqusition System</h1>
<ul>
  <li>rear cover</li>
  <li>cable strain relief clamp</li>
</ul>
Both are held in place by M3 screws (cover: 10 mm, clamp: 16 mm). A strip of foam should be glued to the cover so that the wires are pressed into the foam by the ridge on the clamp.


These data acqusition systems have 3 slots for plug-in boards and sometimes the covers and cable clamps are missing.
Note that some boards also use specific screw terminal blocks (e.g. the relais multiplexer) while others use simpe edge connectors (the digital I/O board). I do not have a solution for thse missing terninal blocks.
