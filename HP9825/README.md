<h1>Parts for the HP 9825 Desktop Calculator</h1>
<ul>
  <li>ROM module case.</li>
  <li>rear cover (may need some metalwork to replace fine nose at bottom.</li>
</ul>

These parts can be used to build a case for a custom ROM or ROM replacement board.

The rear cover must be glued or riveted together and some fine tuning will be necessary to make the retention clip fit into the case. Maybe a small metal or hard plastic strip should be added to make it fit into the thin slot in the foam plastic case of the 9825.
